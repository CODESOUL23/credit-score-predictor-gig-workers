  - 🔴 **High Priority** (80%+ ML confidence) - Red styling with animation
  - 🟡 **Medium Priority** (60-80% ML confidence) - Orange styling  
  - 🟢 **Low Priority** (<60% ML confidence) - Standard styling

### **✅ 3. Clean Suggestion Format**
Updated all 8 recommendation categories:

1. **Payment History**: "Improve payment consistency - current rate: 75.0%"
2. **Credit Utilization**: "Reduce credit usage to below 30% - currently at: 65.0%"
